Event App

# live-demo

https://project-event-app.netlify.app/

# description

Responsive event app created with HTML, Javascript and React + Vite. The app is styled using Chakra UI. For this project, I implemented a navigation bar, search functionality, filtering, click interactions, and buttons to make the app interactive. Users can also add, edit, or delete events, and after one of these actions, a pop-up window will be shown.
